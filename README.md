# PlanningPoker

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

Ready to run in production? Please [check our deployment guides](http://www.phoenixframework.org/docs/deployment).

## Dev notes
I'm following along with https://medium.freecodecamp.org/authentication-using-elixir-phoenix-f9c162b2c398 to get
oauth with google working

That first tutorial was writen assuming Guardian < 1.0, so I used https://medium.com/@tylerpachal/session-authentication-example-for-phoenix-1-3-using-guardian-1-0-beta-a228c78478e6 to get started with guardian itself.
